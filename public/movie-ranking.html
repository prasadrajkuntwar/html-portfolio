<p>
    <h3>Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani</h3>
    <p>Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani is a refreshing take on the lives of the youth(of varied types)-their needs,their aspirations,their madness.</p>
    <h3>12th Fail</h3>
    <p> THE BEST MOVIE OF 2023, period! This is a perfect example of how to take a movie with a strong and inspiring storyline based on true events. It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS. </p>
    <h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
    <p>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is captivating, interesting and entertaining, and it captures the beauty of Spain with great mastery. At times this presentation is too perfect, but then it's a movie so that's what audiences want to see. It is beautifully shot, with excellent cinematography working in its favour.</p>
